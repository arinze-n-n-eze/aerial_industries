## To get started with the project

After cloning this git repository, open your terminal, go into the folder and run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

### Development

Then run `npm start` and start making changes!

### Build and deployment

This project is currently deployed using [Surge](https://surge.sh/) at `https://ipollen8.surge.sh/`! To build and deploy this project, run `npm run build` and then `surge --domain ipollen8.surge.sh` for `project: /Users/jihyunkim/Desktop/iPollen8/build`. Since we are building the contents of the project to `/build` we can specify the deployment copies to take from this directory only.
